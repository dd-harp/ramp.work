**`ramp.work`** has functions to compute scaling relationships: how do various measures of malaria change across the spectrum of malaria transmission intensity?   

This vignette explains the functions in **`ramp.work`**  that:

+ compute scaling relationships

+ visualize scaling relationships

A longer introduction to scaling can be found in [SimBA](https://faculty.washington.edu/smitdave/simba/scaling.html).

`xds_scaling` enables [Metric Conversion](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.work/articles/MetricConversion.html)

## Pseudocode

Suppose that we have defined a model family: we modify a single parameter that changes the mean intensity of exposure or transmission, but we leave the rest of the parameters fixed. 

+ To study the relationship between exposure and malaria outcomes, we might vary the mean annual EIR. 

+ To study the relationship between mosquito density and outcomes, we might vary the average annual emergence rate. $\Lambda.$ 

To compute scaling relationships in systems with a seasonal forcing pattern, we will need to compute the *stable orbits* and link the outputs to the average annual values. 

The function [`xds_scaling`](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.work/reference/xds_scaling.html) handles this task. 

+ create a mesh of values for mean forcing, either 

    - the mean daily EIR, $\bar E.$ 
    
    - the mean daily emergence rate for adult mosquitoes, $\bar \Lambda$ or `Lambda.` 
    
+ for each mesh value:

    - compute and store the stable orbits for important terms
    
    - compute and store the mean values of the stable orbits 
    
## Example 

Load the required packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ramp.xds)
library(ramp.work)
```

Set up a model forced by the EIR with a seasonal pattern, and we use `ramp.xds::show_season` to see the pattern: 

```{r}
Spar  <- makepar_F_sin(bottom = 0.2, pw=2)
model <- xds_setup_eir(eir = 1/365, season_par = Spar)
model <- xds_solve(model)
show_season(model)
```

The function [`xds_scaling`](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.work/reference/xds_scaling.html) computes and stores the values:

+ `xds_scaling$scaling` stores the average annual values by name

+ `xds_scaling$scaling$stable_orbits` stores the stable orbits

```{r}
xds_scaling(model) -> model
names(model$scaling)
```

A `plot_eirpr` plot the *Pf*PR as a function of the average annual *Pf*EIR on a semi-log plot. A function `add_eirpr_orbits` adds the stable orbits for an indexed subset. We use the `virisLite::turbo` color scheme so it is easy to relate the orbit and the mean value.  

```{r}
library(viridisLite)
xds_plot_eirpr(model)
ix_subset = c(9, 13, 17, 21)
add_eirpr_orbits(ix_subset, model, clrs = turbo(25))
```

## Notes 

+ `xds_scaling` dispatches on `xds_obj$forced_by,` which is set up either by `xds_setup_eir` or by the `make_L_obj_trivial.` 

+ The function `xds_scaling.eir()` creates a mesh over logged values of on an even mesh for values of `log(aEIR)` running from $10^{-2}$ up to $10^{3}.$ 

+ The function `xds_scaling.Lambda()` computes a creates a crude mesh. The first step is to compute an approximate pseudo-threshold value $L.$ The initial mesh looks has five values $c(L/100, L/5, L, 5L, 100L).$ Subsequent values are identified by picking a new value in the interval that has the largest change in *Pf*PR. After adding the new value, the
