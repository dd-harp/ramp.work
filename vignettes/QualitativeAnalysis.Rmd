In dynamical systems, qualitative analysis is studies the long-term, general behavior of systems over time without precise quantitative values. Here, we take a computational approach to qualitative analysis for mosquito-transmitted pathogen persistence: stability analysis including threshold and pseudo-threshold criteria; equilibria and stable orbits; scaling relationships; and response timelines. These are introduced in more detail below.
